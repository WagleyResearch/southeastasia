    <p>The Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico were acquired by Spain. They tried to educate them and christianize the Filipinos but they resisted the Americans. Emilio Aguinaldo, the leader of Filipino nationalists demanded the United States grant them freedom from Spain in the event that they win the spanish American war. The United states won and promised the Philippines self rule. The U.S. built roads, railroads and hospitals to achieve this self rule for the Philippines. Led to food shortages because less crops were made.</p>
