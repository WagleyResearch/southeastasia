    A company that held a 21 year monopoly on trade in the East Indies, from the country of the Netherlands. It was the first company to offer stock.  Set records in that it sent millions of Europeans to work in Asia on 4,785 ships.  The company had government like powers, with the power to mint currency, convict and execute people, negotiate treaties and found colonies. The Dutch East India Company or Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) was formed in response to the English East India Company, as the Dutch saw that they would loose out with their companies,  if they were not granted similar powers. The first permanent trading post formed by the Dutch East India Company was Banten, West Java.  This sparked the first of the Dutch spice trading posts.  The English East India Company attempted to establish trading ports in the east indies, however after ten english men were beheaded for conspiracy while attempting to make a deal with the Dutch about trading in the area, the british company pulled out most of their trading from the region. However, The Dutch East India Company, was also not just ruthless to killed almost everyone on the Banda islands. Over time the Dutch East India Company took control over trade from the region.  They were also extremely smart about how the traded in Europe, for example, they always slightly flooded the pepper market, and when other companies started to try to take control of the trade, they stopped their supply, causing the market to crash.</p>
