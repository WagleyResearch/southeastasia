    <h2>Malaysia</h2>
    <p>Malaysia was ruled by the british in several patterns and forms of administration, beginning in the 1860s. Britain brought profound changes economically and socially to Malaysia. There was resistance to british rule and some revolts while they were expanding. People who resisted Britain were called treacherous rebels but later were called nationalist heroes by the malaysians. Britain gained peace and security, and also developed a industrial structure. They also improved transportation, public health facilities, reduced tropical diseases, and developed schools. However, they also exploited Malaysiaâ€™s natural resources. Imperialism in Malaysia was bad, but it was good.
