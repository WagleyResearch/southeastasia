    This area of Southeast Asia was originally controlled by the Portuguese, however, the Dutch soon took control of the region, and added it to their monopoly over trade in the region.  Soon the Lieutenant General of the British colony at Bencoolen though that the British should have more of a trading presence in the region.  The British set up and expedition and found the island of Singapore, and too their luck, it had not been colonized by the Dutch yet.  They found a small Malay settlement there, and when the realized that the sultan of the settlement who was refusing to recognize their settlement was temporary, they smuggled the proper sultan, who had been exiled back, and stuck a deal with him that they would recognize him as sultan if he recognized their settlement. When the British realized that they couldn't form a port from scratch with little funding, they decided to make it a free port. News of this free port spread, and soon people were flocking from all over to avoid having to dock at a Dutch port. The population boomed, and soon millions of dollars of trade was passing through the town. </p>
