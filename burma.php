He joined the Dobama Asiayone (Our Burma Union) as a general secretary, and helped to organize strikes across the country.<br><strong>This is pretty much just a test to show Ben how I think subcontent should work. Of course we can change the border and stuff, but this is scalable, still has margins, and catches the eye.</strong></p>
