    <p>A &ldquo;series of monarchs&rdquo; tried to take control of Burma. In the 1800s, the country had become very unstable, and Britain took advantage of this by trying to take over the region. After three wars over 60 years, Britain finally took control of the country, and annexed it to be a part of British India. Britain then only favored some of the native groups in Burma, and introduced many of their own traditions and customs. This harshly weakened the Burmese culture. Britain also divided the ethnic groups of Burma by favoring only some of them for the military and jobs in local administration, such as the Karen. This created further divides in the country.</p>
    <p>There were some positive aspects of the British imperialism in Burma. Britain's rule grew the economy in the area, with increased demand for Burmese rice. The Suez Canal was also opened, which helped to increase trade.</p>
    <p>There were also a lot of negative aspects of the new British rule in Burma. As noted above, the British favored only some of the ethnic groups in the area for jobs in the military and local administration, creating divisions between these different groups. There was a lot of resistance in Burma, especially in the Northern regions. At one point the British systematically destroyed villages, to ease the resistance.</p>

    <h3>Anglo-Burmese War</h3>
	<p>There was a series of wars along the western border of Burma with the British
over control of the region.  As Burma expanded its borders, they pushed up against
the British East India Company.  This resulted in a war for power of the region.  The British won the first of the wars, however the cost of the wars resulted in the British East India Company losing its power over India. The first Anglo-Burmese war lasted from 1824-1826.
The next of these wars started in 1853 and once again was for control over Burmese territory.  The British won this war in 1878.  The third and final war started in november 1884 and lasted 22 days and resulted in British control of all of Burma, finally annexing the once independent country.</p>

        <h3>Karen People</h3>
        <p>The Karen people were an ethnic group of people in the Burmese region. When Britain imperialism started spreading in Southeast Asia, many Baptist missionaries converted many Karen people to Christianity. When the British took control of Burma, they often favored the Karens for military and local administration jobs.</p>
