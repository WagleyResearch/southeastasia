    <p>A &ldquo;series of monarchs&rdquo; tried to take control of Burma. In the 1800s, the country had become very unstable, and Britain took advantage of this by trying to take over the region. After three wars over 60 years, Britain finally took control of the country, and annexed it to be a part of British India. Britain then only favored some of the native groups in Burma, and introduced many of their own traditions and customs. This harshly weakened the Burmese culture. Britian also divided the ethnic groups of Burma by favoring only some of them for the military and jobs in local administration, such as the Karen. This created further divides in the country.</p>
    <p>There were many positive aspects of the British imperialism in Burma.</p>

	<p>There was a series of wars along the western border of Burma with the British
over control of the region.  As Burma expanded its borders, they pushed up against
the British East India Company.  This resulted in a war for power of the region.  The British won the first of the wars, however the cost of the wars resulted in the British East India Company losing its power over India. The first Anglo-Burmese war lasted from 1824-1826.
The next of these wars started in 1853 and once again was for control over Burmese territory.  The British won this war in 1878.  The third and final war started in november 1884 and lasted 22 days and resulted in British control of all of Burma, finally annexing the once independent country.</p>
